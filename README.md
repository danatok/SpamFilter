Exploring the Ling-Spam email dataset
The following report describes the implementation of the Spam Filter which is developed by using Spark and Scala and implemented in 
Zeppelin notebook. The project covers the techniques that we have learned during the big data class so far, especially how to optimize 
the processing of big data (by parallization) using HDP Sandbox. As for the data set, the project used ling-spam data set which contains 
2412 ham and 481 spam emails. This project aims to find the most informative words (the top words) which can be exploited to distinguish 
spam and ham emails.
